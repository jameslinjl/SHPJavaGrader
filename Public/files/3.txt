<p>Create a class called <b>Statistics</b>.</p>

<p>Implement functions with the following signatures:</p>

<p><code>public static double mix(double[] arr)</code></p>
<p><code>public static double max(double[] arr)</code></p>
<p><code>public static double mean(double[] arr)</code></p>
<p><code>public static double median(double[] arr)</code></p>
<p><code>public static double mode(double[] arr)</code></p>

<p>Each of these functions should be fairly straight-forward. For the mode
function, you can assume that there will only be a single mode in the data
set. You CANNOT assume that the data set will be sorted, BUT you can write
your own function to sort the array. Please do NOT use any built in Java
library sorting functions. You must build your own sort function.</p>

<p>You should also write a class called <b>StatisticsTester</b>. This does not have to
be submitted. The class should have a main method which will prompt the user
to specify a number of doubles they want to add to an array. Then, the user
can type in the number of doubles that they specified and you should calculate
the min, max, mean, and mode of the data set.</p>
