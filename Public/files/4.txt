<p>Create a class called <b>Drunkard</b>.</p>

<p>Implement methods with the following signatures:</p>

<p><code>public Drunkard(int x, int y)</code></p>
<p><code>public void step()</code></p>
<p><code>public void fastForward(int steps)</code></p>
<p><code>public int howFar()</code></p>

<p>The <b>step</b> method will pick a random cardinal direction for your
particular drunkard to step in. The <b>fastForward</b> method will step a number
of times corresponding to the input. The <b>howFar</b> method will return the 
distance using "Manhattan Distance".</p>

<p>You will need to have instance variables / fields with the following names
and permissions:</p>

<p><code>protected int x</code></p>
<p><code>protected int y</code></p>
<p><code>protected int initialX</code></p>
<p><code>protected int initialY</code></p>

<p>You should also write a class called <b>DrunkardTester</b>. This does not have to
be submitted. Use this class to create instances of your Drunkard test to make
sure that all the various methods work.</p>
