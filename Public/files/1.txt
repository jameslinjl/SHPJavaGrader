<p>Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon of spring. To compute the date,
you can use this algorithm, invented by the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1800:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Let y be the year (such as 1800 or 2001).</li>
    <li>Divide y by 19 and call the remainder a. Ignore the quotient.</li>
    <li>Divide y by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c.</li>
    <li>Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e.</li>
    <li>Divide 8 * b + 13 by 25 to get a quotient g. Ignore the remainder.</li>
    <li>Divide 19 * a + b - d - g + 15 by 30 to get a remainder h. Ignore the quotient.</li>
    <li>Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a remainder k.</li>
    <li>Divide a + 11 * h by 319 to get a quotient m. Ignore the remainder.</li>
    <li>Divide 2 * e + 2 * j - k - h + m + 32 by 7 to get a remainder r. Ignore the quotient.</li>
    <li>Divide h - m + r + 90 by 25 to get a quotient n. Ignore the remainder.</li>
    <li>Divide h - m + r + n + 19 by 32 to get a remainder p. Ignore the quotient.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Then Easter falls on day p of month n.

Write a class called <b>EasterCalculator</b> (note that you MUST have this exact
name, or else you won't be able to test your code properly).
</p>

<p>
In this class, write a function that calculates Easter with the following signature:
</p>

<p>
    <code>public static String computeEaster(int year)</code>
</p>

<p>
that takes a year in integer form as input and RETURNS (NOT PRINTS) the date
of Easter as a String, in the format n/p (for example, 4/15 for April 15)
