<p>Create a class called ChangeCalculator.</p>

<p>Implement a function called calculateChange() with the following
signature:</p>

<p><code>public static String calculateChange(int changeInPennies)</code></p>

<p>This function should return a String that describes the optimal number of
dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that a customer should receive if
they are due a certain amount of change described as a number of pennies. The
conversion to pennies is done to avoid roundoff errors that occur in floating
point arithmetic.</p>

<p>Note that to pass the tests, your program MUST return the String formatted in
a particular way. Look at the example code on the course website to see the
exact format expected.</p>

<p>In the main method, ask the user for two values: how much the customer owes
in pennies and how much the customer has actually given in pennies. Then use
your calculateChange() function to tell the cashier what kind of change to give
the customer.</p>
