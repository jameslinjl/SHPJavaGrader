Implement a program that computes the amount of change given blahblah. The program has two inputs: the amount due and the amount received from the customer. Display the dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that the customer should receive in return. In order to avoid roundoff errors, the program user should supply both amounts in pennies, for example 274 instead of $2.74. After making change, the user should be presented with the opportunity to repeat the making chance process again (with a new amount due and amount received). If the user enters "y", then the process repeats. If the user enters "n", then the program terminates.
