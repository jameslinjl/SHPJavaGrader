# SHP Java Grader

This project was born out of a desire to provide simple evaluation and feedback for students of Columbia University's Science Honors Program (enrichment program for high school students), and specifically the Java Programming course taught there. The hope is to build a web service which will easily enable students with very little programming background to get valuable feedback and testing of their code. An additional hope is that instructors and TAs will be able to easily add new assignments to be graded.
